## ðŸ“– About The Project

VizLearn is a collection of interactive, web-based tools designed to make complex machine learning algorithms and data processing concepts intuitive and easy to understand. Each module provides a hands-on visualization that allows you to see the inner workings of an algorithm, manipulate its parameters, and build a stronger mental model of how it operates.

## âœ¨ Features

Explore a growing library of interactive visualizations:

*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Perceptron:** The fundamental building block of neural networks.
    *   **Activation Functions:** Compare Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, and more, interactively.
    *   **Gradient Descent:** Understand how models learn with an interactive playground and a data flow comparison.
    *   **Cosine Similarity:** Visualize vector similarity in a 3D space.
    *   **Tokenization:** See how text is broken down into Words, Characters, or Sentences.
*   **Supervised Learning:**
    *   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classify new data points based on their neighbors.
    *   **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** See how SVMs find the optimal hyperplane to separate data.
    *   **Naive Bayes:** A step-by-step explainer for the classic probabilistic classifier.
*   **Unsupervised Learning:**
    *   **K-Means Clustering:** Watch how clusters are formed and centroids are updated.
*   **Data Processing:**
    *   **Image Data Augmentation:** Apply transformations like rotation, zoom, and noise to see their effect.
    *   **Image Processing:** Visualize Grayscale and RGB images as numerical matrices and apply filters.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Backtracking:** A visualization of the backtracking algorithm solving a maze.
